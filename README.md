# kafi

*kafi* brings the two worlds of Kafka and files together. It is a swiss army knife for Kafka built for two main reasons:
* to make debugging Kafka-based applications more hassle-free
* to empower data scientists to use Kafka in an extremely simple way

*kafi* is the successor of [kash.py](https://github.com/xdgrulez/kash.py) which is the successor of [streampunk](https://github.com/xdgrulez/streampunk).
